# Configure your own permissions.txt CSV configuration file. Here is an example:

# path;user:group;chmod1,chmod2;recurse
# - path: the path you want to check
# - user: the name of the expected user
# - group: the name of the expected group
# - chmod: the access rights to be set
# - recurse: 1 if you want to apply the rights recursively to files and subdirectories

# examples:

/bin/everybodyrunsme;root:root;ugo+rx,go-w
# The /bin/everybodyrunsme script can be run by everyone, but is not writable by users other than root.

/home/{user1,user2};root:root;755
# /home/user1 and /home/user2 must belong to user root and be read/write accessible to everybody (the folder only).

+$home;$user:$user;ugo+rw;1
# All user directories in /home and /root must belong to the corresponding user, be read+write accessible to everyone,
# along with their files and subfolders.
# /home/user1 and /home/user2 will except, because of the configuration line above.
# The files contained into /root/subfolder and its sub-folders will except, due to the configuration line below.
# The + prefix means that the folder should be created if it doesn't already exist.

/root/subfolder/*;user1:user1;go-rwxst;1
# All files in /root/subfolder (not subfolder itself) should belong to user1, and be inaccessible to all other users.
